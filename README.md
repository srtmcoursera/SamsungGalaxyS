The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'CodeBook.md' for more details. 

### Feature vectors

For each record it is provided:

* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
* Its activity label. 
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### Notes

* Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
* Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

### Analysis and cleaning of the dataset

Analysis of the dataset is carried on by the 'run_analysis.R' script, calling higher level function:

        run_analysys()

What this function does is to perform the analysis and cleaning process of the Samsung Galaxy S data set, following steps described next:

1. For the test data set, reads subject IDs, activity IDs, measurement data, and combines them by columns as a single data set.

2. For the train data set, reads subject IDs, activity IDs, measurement data, and combines them by columns as a single data set.

3. Combines both test and train data to create one single data set.

4. Sets the original column names for the subject IDs, activity IDs, and measurement data.

5. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement of the dataset.

6. Decodes dataset activity IDs to their corresponding activity labels.

7. Modifies dataset labels to be more appropiate/descriptive.

8. Creates a tidy data set from the given data, with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

9. Returns this cleaned dataset.
